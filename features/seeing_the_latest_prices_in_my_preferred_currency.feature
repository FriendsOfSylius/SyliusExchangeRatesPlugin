Feature: Seeing the latest prices in my preferred currency
    In order to have the most precise exchange rates on the prices
    As a Customer
    I want them to be updated from a reliable source

    Scenario: Seeing the product price calculated with reliable exchange rate
        Given the store operates on a single channel in "United States"
        And that channel allows to shop using the "EUR" currency
        And the store has a product "Liip T-Shirt" priced at "$9.99"
        And reliable source set the exchange rate between "USD" and "EUR" to "0.82"
        And last night the store updated exchange rates based on this source
        And I have product "Liip T-Shirt" in the cart
        When I switch to the "EUR" currency
        Then my cart's total should be "â‚¬8.19"
